# App modernization hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you implement the steps to modernize a legacy on-premises application, including upgrading and migrating the application and the database to Azure and updating the application to take advantage of serverless and cloud services.

At the end of this hands-on lab, your ability to build solutions for modernizing legacy on-premises applications and infrastructure using cloud services will be improved.

## Overview

Parts Unlimited is an online auto parts store. Founded in Spokane, WA, in 2008, they are providing both genuine OEM and aftermarket parts for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans, and trucks, including new and remanufactured complex parts, maintenance items, and accessories. Its mission is to make buying vehicle replacement parts easy for consumers and professionals. Parts Unlimited has 185 stores in the US, with plans to scale to Mexico and Brazil.

Parts Unlimited has a hosted web application on its internal infrastructure and using a Windows Server, Internet Information Services (IIS), and Microsoft SQL Server to host the solution. Beyond the initial effort and costs, these applications incur ongoing maintenance costs in hardware, operating system updates, and licensing fees. These maintenance costs make Microsoft Azure App Service an attractive alternative. Their team is looking to migrate Microsoft ASP.NET/ Core applications and any SQL Server databases to Azure App Service and Azure SQL Database. However, they are worried that their application might not be supported. They want to know ahead of time the amount of work required to migrate to Azure. They have a project they want to start with to understand the migration process. They wonder if they can move to the cloud now and migrate their application later. What are the options?

Additionally, Parts Unlimited has plans to increase its marketing investment, currently on hold because of scaling issues. The company is stuck and can't grow without increasing its infrastructure footprint. Their CEO wants to finalize their cloud vs. on-premises decision based on the current migration effort's success. The engineering team is worried about their order processing subsystem. Currently, they have a strongly coupled order processing system that runs synchronously during checkout. When moved to the cloud, they don't want to be worried about their order processing system's scalability. They are looking for a modern approach with the least migration effort possible.

Finally, Parts Unlimited is looking to invest in DevOps practices to decrease human error in deployments. They are looking for options to have a staging environment to test functionality before shipping to production. However, their team does not have any experience in building CI/CD pipelines. They are not sure if this goal is achievable in the short term, and they do not want it to hold up their migration to the cloud.

## Solution architecture

Below is a high-level architecture diagram of the solution you implement in this hands-on lab. Please review this carefully to understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This solution diagram includes a high-level overview of the architecture implemented within this hands-on lab.](media/architecture-diagram.png "Solution architecture diagram")

> **Note:** The solution provided is only one of many possible, viable approaches.

The solution begins with setting up Azure Migrate as the central assessment and migration hub for Parts Unlimited's E-Commerce website. Using the App Service Migration Assistant tool from Azure Migrate, Parts Unlimited found that their website is fully compatible with Azure App Service. As a next step, they use App Service Migration Assistant to provision an Azure App Service environment and deploy their application to Azure. Following the success in moving the web application, Parts Unlimited uses the Data Migration Assistant (DMA) assessment to determine that they can migrate into a fully-managed SQL Database service in Azure. The assessment reveals no compatibility issues or unsupported features that would prevent them from using Azure SQL Database.

Next, Parts Unlimited sets up a private GitHub repository and pushes their codebase to GitHub. They set up deployment slots to have a staging environment to test functionality before releasing to production. As a CI/CD solution, they decide to use GitHub Actions and Workflows.

Finally, Parts Unlimited decides to decouple its order processing system and move to an event-driven serverless compute platform. Following a [web-queue-worker architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/web-queue-worker), they build an Azure Function and use Azure Storage Queue to process orders and create invoices asynchronously. When new orders come in, the web front end adds jobs into the queue consumed by Azure Functions. The Functions App scales independently based on the number of jobs in the queue, helping Parts Unlimited elastically handle a variable amount of orders.

## Requirements

    ![Azure Migrate databases section is open. Azure Migrate Database Assessment and Database Migration tools are presented.](media/azure-migrate-database-migration-ready.png "Azure Migrate Database Migration and Assessment Tools")

## Exercise 2: Migrate your application with App Service Migration Assistant

Duration: 20 minutes

The first step for Parts Unlimited is to assess whether their apps have dependencies on unsupported features on Azure App Service. In this exercise, you use an **Azure Migrate** tool called the [App Service migration assistant](https://appmigration.microsoft.com/) to evaluate Parts Unlimited's website for a migration to Azure App Service. The assessment runs readiness checks and provides potential remediation steps for common issues. Once the assessment succeeds, we will proceed with the migration as well. You will use a simulated on-premises environment hosted in virtual machines running on Azure.

### Task 1: Perform assessment for migration to Azure App Service

Parts Unlimited would like an assessment to see what potential issues they might need to address in moving their application to Azure App Service. You will use the [App Service migration assistant](https://appmigration.microsoft.com/) to assess the application and run various readiness checks.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **WebVM** VM by selecting **Resource groups** from Azure services list, selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and selecting the **WebVM** VM from the list of resources.

    ![The WebVM virtual machine is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/webvm-selection.png "WebVM Selection")

2. Go back to the Azure Portal. On the WebVM Virtual Machine's **Overview** blade, select **Connect (1)** and **RDP (2)** on the top menu.

   ![The WebVM VM blade is displayed, with the Connect button highlighted in the top menu.](media/connect-rdp-webvm.png "WebVM RDP Connect")

3. Select **Download RDP File** on the next page, and open the downloaded file.

    > **Note**: The first time you connect to the WebVM Virtual Machine, you will see a blue pop-up terminal dialog taking you through a couple of software installs. Don't be alarmed, and wait until the installs are complete.

    ![RDP Window is open. Download RDP File button is highlighted.](media/rdp-download.png "WebVM RDP File Download")

4. Select **Connect** on the Remote Desktop Connection dialog.

    ![In the Remote Desktop Connection Dialog Box, the Connect button is highlighted.](media/remote-desktop-connection-webvm.png "Remote Desktop Connection dialog")

5. Enter the following credentials with your password when prompted, and then select **OK**:

   - **Username**: demouser
   - **Password**: {YOUR-ADMIN-PASSWORD}
  
    > **Note**: default password is `Password.1!!`

    ![The credentials specified above are entered into the Enter your credentials dialog.](media/rdp-credentials-webvm.png "Enter your credentials")

6. Select **Yes** to connect, if prompted that the identity of the remote computer cannot be verified.

    ![In the Remote Desktop Connection dialog box, a warning states that the remote computer's identity cannot be verified and asks if you want to continue anyway. At the bottom, the Yes button is circled.](media/remote-desktop-connection-identity-verification-webvm.png "Remote Desktop Connection dialog")

7. Once logged into the WebVM VM, a script will execute to install the various items needed for the remaining lab steps.
    >**Warning:** You must wait for all of the scripts to finish installing and configuring the software when you first log in. DO NOT shutdown the PowerShell script.  The PowerShell script creates the database and seeds the tables with data. Failing to wait for the script to complete will prevent you from finishing the rest of the lab.

    ![The image shows the Windows PowerShell opening screen.](media/windows-powershell.png "PowerShell Opening Screen")

8. Once the PowerSell script has completed, the web server should be configured now. Return to the Azure Portal, on the WebVM Virtual Machine's **Overview (1)** blade, copy the **Public IP address (2)**.

    ![The WebVM VM blade is displayed, Public IP Address copy button is highlighted.](media/web-vm-ip.png "WebVM Overview and Public IP")

9. Open a new browser window and navigate to the IP Address you copied.

    >**Note:** If you cannot see the web page properly display, then your web server configuration may be incorrect.

    ![The WebVM VM blade is displayed, Public IP Address copy button is highlighted.](media/parts-umlimited-web-site.png "Parts Unlimited Web Site")

10. Once the script completes, open **AppServiceMigrationAssistant** that is located on the desktop.

    ![AppServiceMigrationAssistant is highlighted on the desktop.](media/appservicemigrationassistant-desktop.png "App Service Migration Assistant")

11. Once App Service Migration Assistant discovers the websites available on the server, choose **Default Web Site (1)** for migration and select **Next (2)** to start the assessment.

    ![AppServiceMigrationAssistant is open. Default Web Site is selected. The next button is highlighted.](media/appservicemigration-choose-site.png "App Service Migration Assistant Web Site selection")

12. Observe the result of the assessment report. In our case, our application has successfully passed 13 tests **(1)** with no additional actions needed. Now that our assessment is complete, select **Next (2)** to proceed to the migration.

   ![Assessment report result is shown. There are 13 success metrics presented. The next button is highlighted.](media/appservicemigration-report.png "Assessment Report")

   > For the details of the readiness checks, see [App Service Migration Assistant documentation](https://github.com/Azure/App-Service-Migration-Assistant/wiki/Readiness-Checks).

### Task 2: Migrate the web application to Azure App Service

After reviewing the assessment results, you have ensured the web application is a good candidate for migration to Azure App Service. Now, we will continue the process with the migration of the application.

1. In order to continue with the migration of our website Azure App Service Migration Assistant needs access to our Azure Subscription. Select **Copy Code & Open Browser** button to be redirected to the Azure Portal.

   ![Azure App Service Migration Assistant's Azure Login dialog is open. A device code is presented. Copy Code & Open Browser button is highlighted.](media/appservicemigration-azure-login.png "Azure Login")

2. At its first launch, you will be asked to choose a browser. Select **Microsoft Edge (1)**  and check **Always use this app (2)** checkbox. Select **OK (2)** to move to the next step.

    ![Browser choice dialog is shown. Microsoft Edge is selected. Always use this app checkbox is checked. OK button is highlighted.](media/browser-choice.png "Default Browser Selection")

3. Right-click the text box and select **Paste (1)** to paste your login code. Select **Next** to give subscription access to App Service Migration Assistant.

    ![Azure Code Login website is open. Context menu for the code textbox is shown. Paste command from the context menu is highlighted. The next button is highlighted as a second step. ](media/appservicemigration-azure-login-code.png "Enter Authentication Code")

4. Continue the login process with your Azure Subscription credentials. When you see the message that says **You have signed in to the Azure App Service Migration Assistant application on your device** close the browser window and return to the App Service Migration Assistant.

    ![Azure Login process is complete. A message dialog is shown that indicates the login process is a success.](media/appservicemigration-azure-login-complete.png "App Service Migration Assistant authentication approval")

5. Select the Azure Migrate project we created **(1)** in the previous exercise to submit our migration results. Select **Next** to continue.
    >**Note:** If you do not see your Azure Migrate Project, you may have switch user directory (subscriptions) to the directory where the project was created.

    ![Azure Migrate Project is set to partsunlimitedweb. The next button is highlighted.](media/appservicemigration-azure-migrate.png "Azure Migrate Hub integration")

6. Verify you are in the correct subscription. In order to migrate Parts Unlimited website, we have to create an App Service Plan. The Azure App Service Migration Assistant will take care of all the requirements needed. Select **Use existing (1)** and select the lab resource group as your deployment target. App Service requires a globally unique Site Name. We suggest using a pattern that matches `partsunlimited-web-{uniquesuffix}` **(2)**. Select **Migrate** to start the migration process.

    ![Deployment options are presented. The existing lab resource group is selected as the destination. The destination site name is set to partsunlimited-web-20X21. Migrate button is highlighted.](media/appservicemigration-migrate.png "Azure App Service Migration Assistant Options")

## Exercise 3: Migrate the on-premises database to Azure SQL Database

Duration: 55 minutes

The next step of Part Unlimited's migration project is the assessment and migration of its database. Currently, the database lives on a SQL Server 2008 R2 on a virtual machine. You will use an **Azure Migrate: Database Assessment** tool called **Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA)** to assess the `PartsUnlimited` database for a migration to Azure SQL Database. The assessment generates a report detailing any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and Azure SQL Database. After the assessment, you will use an **Azure Migrate: Database Migration** service called **Azure Database Migration Service (DMS)**. During the exercise, you will use a simulated on-premises environment hosted in virtual machines running on Azure.

### Task 1: Perform assessment for migration to Azure SQL Database

Parts Unlimited would like an assessment to see what potential issues they might need to address in moving their database to Azure SQL Database. In this task, you will use the [Microsoft Data Migration Assistant](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/dma/dma-overview?view=sql-server-2017) (DMA) to assess the `PartsUnlimited` database against Azure SQL Database (Azure SQL DB). Data Migration Assistant (DMA) enables you to upgrade to a modern data platform by detecting compatibility issues that can impact database functionality on your new version of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. It recommends performance and reliability improvements for your target environment. The assessment generates a report detailing any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the Azure SQL DB service.

> **Note**: You should have completed step to log into the WebVM. The source database is now available. The Database Migration Assistant is already downloaded on your SqlServer2008 VM. It can be downloaded through Azure Migrate or from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090807) as well.

1. Connect to your SqlServer2008 VM with RDP. Your credentials are the same as the WebVM , `demouser` with `Password.1!!` password.

   ![The SQLServer2008 virtual machine is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/find-sqlserver2008-resource.png "SqlServer2008 Selection")

2. Open Windows explorer and install the migration assistant from `c:\DataMigrationAssistant.msi`.

3. Launch DMA from the Windows desktop icon or Start menu by typing "data migration" into the search bar and then selecting **Microsoft Data Migration Assistant** in the search results.

    > **Note**: There is a known issue with screen resolution when using an RDP connection to Windows Server 2008 R2, which may affect some users. This issue presents itself as very small, hard-to-read text on the screen. The workaround for this is to use a second monitor for the RDP display, allowing you to scale up the resolution to make the text larger.

   ![In the Windows Start menu, "data migration" is entered into the search bar, and Microsoft Data Migration Assistant is highlighted in the Windows start menu search results.](media/windows-start-menu-dma.png "Data Migration Assistant")

4. In the DMA dialog, select **+** from the left-hand menu to create a new project.

   ![The new project icon is highlighted in DMA.](media/dma-new.png "New DMA project")

5. In the New project pane, set the name of the project **(1)** and make sure the following value are selected:

   - **Project type**: Select Assessment.
   - **Project name (1)**: Enter **Assessment**.
   - **Assessment type**: Select Database Engine.
   - **Source server type**: Select SQL Server.
   - **Target server type**: Select Azure SQL Database.

   ![New project settings for doing an assessment of a migration from SQL Server to Azure SQL Database.](media/dma-new-project-to-azure-sql-db.png "New project settings")

6. Select **Create (2)**.

7. On the **Options** screen, ensure **Check database compatibility (1)** and **Check feature parity (1)** are both checked, and then select **Next (2)**.

   ![Check database compatibility and check feature parity are checked on the Options screen.](media/dma-options.png "DMA options")

8. On the **Sources** screen, select **Add sources**.

9. Connect to the local SQL Server named SQLSERVER2008. Enter the following into the **Connect to a server** dialog that appears on the right-hand side:

    - **Server name (1)**: Enter **SQLSERVER2008**.
    - **Authentication type (2)**: Select **SQL Server Authentication**.
    - **Username (3)**: Enter **PUWebSite**
    - **Password (4)**: Enter **{YOUR-ADMIN-PASSWORD}** `Password.1!!`
    - **Encrypt connection**: Check this box if not checked.
    - **Trust server certificate (5)**: Check this box.

    ![In the Connect to a server dialog, the values specified above are entered into the appropriate fields.](media/dma-connect-to-a-server.png "Connect to a server")

10. Select **Connect (6)**.

11. On the **Add sources** dialog that appears next, check the box for `PartsUnlimited` **(1)** and select **Add (2)**.

    ![The PartsUnlimited box is checked on the Add sources dialog.](media/dma-add-sources.png "Add sources")

12. Select **Start Assessment**.

    ![Start assessment](media/dma-start-assessment-to-azure-sql-db.png "Start assessment")

13. Take a moment to review the assessment for migrating to Azure SQL DB. The SQL Server feature parity report **(1)** shows that Analysis Services and SQL Server Reporting Services are unsupported **(2)**, but these do not affect any objects in the `PartsUnlimited` database, so they won't block a migration.

    ![The feature parity report is displayed, and the two unsupported features are highlighted.](media/dma-feature-parity-report.png "Feature parity")

14. Now, select **Compatibility issues (1)** so you can review that report as well.

    ![The Compatibility issues option is selected and highlighted.](media/dma-compatibility-issues.png "Compatibility issues")

    The DMA assessment for migrating the `PartsUnlimited` database to a target platform of Azure SQL DB reveals that no issues or features are preventing Parts Unlimited from migrating their database to Azure SQL DB.

15. Select **Upload to Azure Migrate** to upload assessment results to Azure.

    ![Upload to Azure Migrate button is highlighted.](media/dma-upload-azure-migrate.png "Azure Migrate Upload")

## Exercise 5: Using serverless Azure Functions to process orders

Duration: 30 minutes

With its migration to Azure, Parts Unlimited plans to launch a series of campaigns to increase its sales. Their current architecture is processing purchase orders synchronously and is coupled with their front end. Parts Unlimited is looking for ways to decouple its order processing system and make sure it can scale independently from the web front end when orders increase.

You suggest a serverless approach that can handle order processing and the creation of invoices for processed orders. In this exercise, you will deploy a serverless Azure Function that will listen to an Azure Storage Queue and process orders as they come. Parts Unlimited has already implemented the changes required to push the jobs into a queue of your choice.
